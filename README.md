#Overview
This application is built using Play Framework 2.5.4. If you need instructions outside of what is in this README please visit: https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/Home. The main purpose of this app is to cache GitHub Api responses. It additionally provides some post processing of the Netflix repos list by providing an API by which to access the repos sorted by certain metrics.
